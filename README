This is a group project made by Andy Peng and Kechun (Coco) Mao as their final
project for the course 15-237 Special Topic: Cross-Platform Mobile Web Apps.

The project is a site for creating, distributing, and taking surveys. The site
has tools to create your own survey and generate a unique URL for distribution,
it allows users to sign up to create and take surveys and has a credit system
to incentivize survey-taking, and it allows you to view survey results as a pie
chart or in tabular form.

On the backend, user data and surveys are stored on a MongoDB database running
on a Node.js server using the mongoose package. The other Node.js packages used
are Express as a web application framework and Passport for user
authentication.

On the frontend, jQuery and Underscore.js are used to load surveys and user
data onto a fully responsive, mobile-friendly UI created with Bootstrap.

The screenshot folder shows each page a user would encounter throughout the 
site on both a mobile browser and a desktop browser. To run the project:
1. Open a terminal in the "SurveyBasket" directory
2. Run the command "./mongodb-osx-x86_64-2.2.2/bin/mongod --dbpath data/db/" to
   start the mongodb server
3. Open another terminal in the "SurveyBasket" directory
4. Run the command "node server.js" to start the node server
5. Open a browser and load the URL "http://localhost:3000/"

A version of the site is also hosted at http://surveybasket.heroku.com/ and an
Android app of the site was created using PhoneGap and included in the 
repository as "Surveybasket.apk"
